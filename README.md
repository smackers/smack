SMACK is both a *modular software verification toolchain* and a
*self-contained software verifier*. It can be used to verify the assertions
in its input programs. In its default mode, assertions are verified up to a
given bound on loop iterations and recursion depth; it contains experimental
support for unbounded verification as well. SMACK handles complicated feature
of the C language, including dynamic memory allocation, pointer arithmetic, and
bitwise operations.

Under the hood, SMACK is a translator from the [LLVM](http://www.llvm.org)
compiler's popular intermediate representation (IR) into the
[Boogie](https://github.com/boogie-org/boogie) intermediate verification language (IVL).
Sourcing LLVM IR exploits an increasing number of compiler front-ends,
optimizations, and analyses. Currently SMACK only supports the C language via
the [Clang](http://clang.llvm.org) compiler, though we are working on providing
support for additional languages. Targeting Boogie exploits a canonical
platform which simplifies the implementation of algorithms for verification,
model checking, and abstract interpretation. Currently, SMACK leverages the
[Boogie](https://github.com/boogie-org/boogie) and [Corral](https://github.com/boogie-org/corral)
verifiers.

See below for system requirements, installation, usage, and everything else.
